  <h3>Introduction - Meet the Team</h3>

  <p class="blurb">
    Not a team as such but just me and that's how I like it. You are my team and together we can tackle just about anything.
    Improving your mindfulness, losing weight, changing your lifestyle, simply keeping fit—some of these or even all of them, we can achieve them together.
  <br /><br />
    During the first lockdown, I discovered a taste for running. I soon realised that simply running wasn't enough and that different forms of exercise were needed.
    I started with smallish weights and began to build upper body strength, which helped my running and the different exercises complemented each other.
  <br /><br />
    Just keeping fit had become part of my life, and I found that I absolutely love it. It quickly became a part of my normal routine.  
    Exercise gave me a sense of freedom and helped me focus better on the everyday trials that we all face. I decided that I wanted to take this further, and when the opportunity
    for my Level 2 Instructor's Course came up, I took it and never looked back.
  <br /><br />
    Personal training became my job and my hobby all in one, and I enjoy nothing more than helping others achieve their goals. I soon took my Level 3 as well as other courses, including Boxercise, also known as Boxfit, my Spin Instructor's Course, and gained further experiences taking classes in and around the area.
    I still run classes at various centres as well as a few of my own, but my speciality lies with personal training. Don't get me wrong, my classes are excellent and benefit many people in different ways while
    being able to socialise and have fun. Personal training is where I can really help individuals become the best version of themselves.
